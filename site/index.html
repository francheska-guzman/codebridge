<h2 class="orange">Some sources to learn HTML, CSS and Git!</h2>
</div>

<div id="left">
<h3 class="darkblue">HTML</h3>
<h4 class="babyblue">HyperText Markup Language</h4>
<p class="brown">HTML is the standard markup language to create web pages and web applications. It describes the structure of a web page or web application semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. Also, provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links and quotes.</p>
</div>

<div id="center">
<h3 class="darkblue">CSS</h3>
<h4 class="babyblue">Cascading Style Sheets</h4>
<p class="brown">CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language (i.e. HTML).
<br><br>
It is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the fonts, colors and layout.
</p>

<div id="right">
<h3 class="darkblue">JavaScript</h3>
<h4 class="babyblue">SubTitle</h4>
<p class="brown">JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.  It is a prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. 
<br><br>
In addition to HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.  All modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins!

<h3 class="darkblue">Git</h3>
<h4 class="babyblue">Version Control System (CVS)</h4>

<div id="belowleft">
<p class="brown">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle from small to very large projects.  It helps, amongst other features, to add access control, display the contents of a Git repository via the web, track changes in files and coordinating work with other people.</p>
</div>
<div id="belowright">
<p class="brown">To learn more about Git, I strongly recommend you this book:
<br><br>
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2" target="_blank"><img class="animation" src="images/progit.png" alt="Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, Second Edition" style="width:160px;height:200px;">
</a>
<br><br>
Also, I recommend you create an account in an online project hosting like <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!
