<h3 class="darkblue">Git</h3>
<h4 class="babyblue">Version Control System (CVS)</h4>
<p class="brown">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle from small to very large projects.  It helps, amongst other features, to add access control, display the contents of a Git repository via the web, track changes in files and coordinating work with other people. <br><br>In order to learn more about Git, I strongly recommend you this book: 
<br><br>
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2"><img src="images/progit.png" alt="Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, Second Edition" style="width:160px;height:200px;">
</a> 
<br><br>
Also, I recommend you create an account in an online project hosting like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>!
