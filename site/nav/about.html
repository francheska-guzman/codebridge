<div id="mission">
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Be prepared to apply and be part of the CodeBridge training course, offered by Per Scholas in partnership with General Assembly. Acquire the knowledge and skills to become a full stack Web Developer. In order to achieve this goal, I started to learn by myself about HTML and CSS, and this is the result. Imagine what I can do if I learn more coding languages!</p>

<div id="vision">
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>Have a continuing education in this field to be up to date. Fully meet the expectations of the companies and/or individuals who requires my service... an outstanding service! </p>
