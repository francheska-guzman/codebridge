<h2>About Getting Ready for CodeBridge</h2>
<p>This website is created with the purpose to practice what I learn on my own about HTML and CSS.  I decided to use the colors and font of the Per Scholas website, as a way to show my enthusiasm for the institution and the program, and this is the result. Imagine what I can do if I learn more coding languages!</p>
